# ✔- Full Stack Search Engine - ✔

_**In this webproject as part of the SAE Bachelor program 6GST0XD10x I'm building a full stack search engine with next.js using postgres full-text search and semantic quaring Upstash Vectorto be able to use it on a separate subpage depending on the initial situation for my website: www.toycarsaddict.club. You can also find access to the project on my developer page: www.svendolin-productions.ch - I also tried to implement another interesting way of searching: the so called reverse image search.**_

## Q&A - Questions and Answers about this project ✅
***

 **A) Why building an own search engine?**
* I find the topic extremely interesting and profound. It is a very complex topic that involves many different aspects. Many background processes are not even noticed by users or are not made transparent by the operators of search engines such as Google. Through a project like this, I can get a better picture of how a search engine works, which processes are necessary and how I can build a search engine that is as user-friendly as possible. Fortunately, there are a number of research options on the subject, in addition to videos, such as a collection of digital content that I have compiled here:
[PERLEGO.COM](https://perlego.com/join-workspace?groupId=4dc18161-9e0a-4e9d-b920-2312bc914dc1) (Btw you need a Perlego account to access the content)

 **B) Was hat das Projekt mit Modellautos zu tun?**
* Ich führe seit mehreren Jahren sehr erfolgreich ein Business, was sich rund um das Thema Modellautos im Massstab 1:64 dreht
